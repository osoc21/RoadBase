# RoadBase - Deployment directions
## Applications
RoadBase consists of the following services that need to be deployed:
### Frontend
The frontend is a simple Ember application that runs in a docker container.

### Backend
The RoadBase backend consists of multiple services:
- semtech/mu-identifier:1.9.1
- semtech/mu-dispatcher:2.0.0
  - Mounted volumes: ./config/dispatcher:/config
- tenforce/virtuoso:virtuoso7.2.5
  - Environment variables: SPARQL_UPDATE & DEFAULT_GRAPH
  - Mounted volumes: ./data/db:/data and ./config/virtuoso.ini:/data/virtuoso.ini
- semtech/mu-cl-resources:1.20.0
  - Mounted volumes: ./config/resources:/config
- semtech/mu-migrations-service:0.7.0
  - Mounted volumes: ./config/migrations:/data/migrations
  - Environment variables: BATCH_SIZE (Otherwise virtuoso will create pretty long SQL queries and keep retrying with a smaller batch size until it succeeds)

### Caddy
open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go. Also running in a docker container.

## Github actions
All docker images are build and pushed to docker hub using github actions ([roadbase-main.yml](https://github.com/osoc21/RoadBase/blob/master/.github/workflows/roadbase-main.yml)).

If you want to change which docker hub repository the images are pushed to, change DOCKER_PASSWORD and DOCKER_USER in the github "secrets" settings:

## Deployment
To setup deployment on any server, a [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/osoc21/RoadBase/blob/master/misc/deployment/docker-compose.yml) has been created in this folder. If the docker hub repository has changed, don't forget to edit the image links in this file as well.

## Server
_Issue: Importing the accident database and migrating it to linked open data generates a huge load on the server which causes the docker compose to fail if not enough memory is available (tried using 1gb of RAM on a digital ocean droplet). The current fix was to only migrate a small part of this dataset to prove technical viability._

The way this deployment is setup, no source is needed on the server itself. The only file that is necessary is the docker-compose.yml file.

### Full setup
- Install docker on the server: [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- Copy and edit [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/osoc21/RoadBase/blob/master/misc/deployment/docker-compose.yml) to use the correct docker hub images.
- Run docker-compose up in the directory on the server that contains the docker-compose.yml file. This will also spin up the Caddy server image so no nginx is needed.
- If desired, follow the watchtower documentation for automatic deployment to the server.

## Automatic deployment
For the automatic deployment, [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) will be used to automate the refresh of the images after they are pushed to docker hub.

(more documentation to be added while doing the actual deploy)
